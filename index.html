    <p>
        Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer <br>
        to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, <br>
        you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.<br>
        <br>
        Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.<br>
        <br>
        Examples<br>
        <br>
        "4556364607935616" --> "############5616"<br>
            "64607935616" -->      "#######5616"<br>
                    "1" -->                "1"<br>
                        "" -->                 ""<br>
                        <br>
        // "What was the name of your first pet?"<br>
        <br>
        "Skippy" --> "##ippy"<br>
        <br>
        "Nananananananananananananananana Batman!"<br>
        --><br>
        "####################################man!"<br>
